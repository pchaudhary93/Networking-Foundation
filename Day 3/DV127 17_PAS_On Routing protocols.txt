Q1. A loopback interface is a virtual interface created on a_____________
A1. Router


Q2. In terminal when we are in configuration mode we need to enter __________key for interface
A2. INT 


Q3. A routing table is a file that contains a set of __________that shows information on what path a data packet takes to its destination 
A3.  Rules


Q4. What does a basic routing table contain?
A4. A basic routing table contains a network destination which is an IP address of the final destination. 


Q5. In order data to travel across a network and reach its destination, it needs a map to determine the best path to take and a way it does this is using a ______protocols
A5. Routing 


Q6. Routing protocols collect information about the current network status and map out the best path for ______________to take to their specific destination. 
A6. Data packets


Q7. What are the types of routing protocols?
A7. The three types of routing protocols:
        Distance Vector
        Link State
        Hybrid


Q8. Distance vector protocols are factors in distance to the destination based on how many hops. (True/False)
A8. True


Q9. RIP stands for______________ 
A9. Routing Information Protocol 


Q10. RIP is the oldest routing protocol. Routers that uses RIP, broadcasts their routing information to other routers in every 30 seconds (True/False)
A10. True 


Q11. Why did the developers create RIPv2?
A11. The developers created a RIPv2 to solve the problem of excessive broadcasts traffic that RIPv1 created.

A12  Border gateway Protocol


Q12.1. BGP determines ___________that are based on paths and policies
A12.1.  Routing directions


Q13. Link state is a routing protocol that is used by_____________ to share information and independently map out the best path on a network. 
A13.  Routers 


Q14. Give example of link state protocol
A14.  Two examples of link state protocol are: OSPF and IS-IS. 


Q15. OSPF stands for _____________________
A15.  Open Shortest Path First. 


Q16. IS-IS which stands for___________________
A16.  Intermediate System to Intermediate System. 


Q17. IS-IS primarily functions within domains and it uses Connectionless Network Service.  (True/False)
A17.  True


Q18. EIGRP stands for___________________
A18.  Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol


Q19. SIP stands for ________________ 
A19. Session Initiation Protocol


Q20. VOIP is _____________IP 
A20. Voice Over 


Q21. RTP stands for __________________
A21. Real-Time Transport Protocol
