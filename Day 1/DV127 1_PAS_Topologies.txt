Q1 What do you mean by “TOPOLOGY”?
A The layout of how a network communicates with different devices is called “TOPOLOGY.”

Q2
Name the most common Topology?
A: The most common topology is the “Star Topology.”

Q3 In ___________ topology the computers are connected to the central wiring point such as a Hub or a Switch.
A: Star Topology

Q4 Data on Star Network  passes through the _________ point before continuing to its destination.
A: Central

Q5 The major benefits of Star  topology is that if  one computer failed or if there was a break in a cable the other computers will  not be affected. Why?
A: The major benefits of this topology is that if there is one computer failed or if there was a break in a cable the other computers were not be effected because each computer has their own cable connection. 

Q6 Major disadvantage of a star topology is that if the central hub or switch fails, the other computers on that central point would be affected and this is called a ?
A: However a disadvantage of a star topology is that if central hub or switch fails, the other computers on that central point would be effected and this is called a “Single Point Failure” if this happens the entire network goes down. 

Q7 What happens if we have Single Point of Failure?
A: The entire network goes down. 

	Q8
	Name the network topology where  computer devices and network devices are connected to a single cable? 
	Ans
	Bus Topology

	Q9
	Backbone of Bus Topology is known as?
	Ans
	Coaxial cable

	Q10
	In Bus Topology, the  computers are connected with this cable using special connectors called BNC which are also known as ?
	 Ans
	T-Connectors

	Q11
	One of the advantages of the bus topology is ?
	Ans
	It is very cheap and easy to implement.

	Q12
	However the disadvantage of the bus topology is that it requires that the cable be terminated at both ends using ?
	Ans
	Terminators

	Q13
	If a computer is removed or added or if terminators are loose or missing then the cable would be open and data will bounce back and this is known as ? 
	Ans
	Signal-reflection

	Q14
	What happens if we have signal-reflection?
	Ans
	The dataflow will be disrupted.

	Q15
	Name the type of network configuration where each computer is connected to each other and shaped of a closed loop or ring so every computer on this ring has exactly two neighbors
	Ans
	The ring topology

	Q16
	The advantage of ring topology is that it is easy to ?
	Ans
	Install and easy to troubleshoot.

	Q17
	The dis-advantage of ring topology ?
	Ans
	Just one of these computers goes down or if there was a single break in the cable then all data flow would be disrupted.

	Q18
	Name a network setup where each computer and network device is interconnected with one another?
	Ans
	Mesh Topology

	Q19
	In Mesh Topology each computer on the network connects to every other computer on the network so by having so many connections it handles_____ very well.
	Ans
	Failure

	Q20
	Mesh Topology  setup allows for most transmissions to be distributed even if ___ of the connections goes down. 

	Ans
	One 

	Q21
	Mesh Topology  is  commonly used for?
	Ans
	Wireless networks

	Q22
	Mesh Topology can be expensive due to ?
	Ans
	Because of the amount of cabling and network cards that have to be used, mesh topology can be expensive.

	Q23
	Due to expensive Mesh Topology is rarely used in _________ Area Network.
	Ans
	Local Area Network or LANs.

	Q24
	Mesh Topology is mainly used in _______ Area Network.
	Ans
	Wide Area Network

	Q25
	Name a perfect example of Mesh Topology?
	Ans
	The Internet is the perfect example of Mesh Topology.

	Q26
	The advantage of Mesh Topology is it creates a ?
	Ans
	A high redundancy level because if one or more connections fails the computer will still be able to communicate with each other as you can see on the illustration.

	Q27
	Will computers still be able to communicate In Mesh Topology what happens if One or more connections fail? (YES /NO)
	Ans
	Yes

	Q28
	Topologies can also be combined with other topologies if needed and these were known as ?
	Ans
	Hybrid Topology

	Q29
	Name the  most common form of hybrid topologies 
	Ans
	Star ring network and Star bus network.

	Q30
	In a Star Bus network ________ star topologies linked together using a single cable bus connection.
	Ans
	Two or more

	Q31
	In a Star Ring network_________ring networks are linked together to form a large link network.  
	Ans
	Two or more

	Q32
	In Point to Point Topology are two hosts that are directly connected to each other using______.
	Ans
	A single cable

	Q33
	 These hosts could be____?
	Ans
	Computers, switches, routers, servers and so on. 

	Q34
	In A Client Server Topology  clients connect directly to a ____________to access resources rather than connecting to each other.
	Ans
	Centralized dedicated server

	Q35
	Why do a lot of businesses use this Client Server  topology?
	Ans 
	Because instead of having to put all the resources on each computer which is a lot more work. The administrative can just put all the data on one machine and then all the clients can access the resources when they needed.

	Ans
	Point to Multipoint Topology
